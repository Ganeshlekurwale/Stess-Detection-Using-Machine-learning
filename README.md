## Project Challenge

The challenge of stress detection using machine learning involves the utilization of physiological data and self-reported information to build a model that can recognize stress patterns. The project explores various machine learning techniques such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees. After a thorough evaluation, the best accuracy scores were achieved with Naive Bayes (73%), followed by Logistic Regression (72%), and Decision Trees (61%). The output is presented in binary format.
